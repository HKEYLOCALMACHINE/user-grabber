# CHECK IF TELEGRAM USERNAME BUSY OR NOT WITH DUMB PYTHON SCRIPT USING [FRAGMENT.COM](https://fragment.com/) API

### ü™≤ NOTE! FOR NOW THERE ARE SOME FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS IN CATEGORY OF FREE USERNAMES I WILL FIX SOON!

### Installation and Run (Local)
1. `git clone https://github.com/S4kur4H4run0/telegram-username-grabber.git & cd telegram-username-grabber`
2. `python3.12 -m venv env`
3. `source env/bin/activate`
4. `pip install requirements.txt`

**Run the script with `python --file [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/usernames/list.txt] --verbose`**

### Running in GitHub Actions environment
If you want to test running in my repository actions create an issue with `Payload request` template and put a single url in the body and wait until I approve pipeline run ü•è

### Payload limitations
For now only files hosted on `raw.githubusercontent.com` accepted and usernames must be divided by new lines. File format [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Usernames/Names/names.txt)

**The results of workflow runs is accessible on [actions](https://github.com/S4kur4H4run0/telegram-username-grabber/actions) page**
