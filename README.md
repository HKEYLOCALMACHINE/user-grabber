# TELEGRAM USERNAME VALIDATOR AND CHECKER
This Python script checks if a Telegram username is available or taken using the [fragment](https://fragment.com/) website and the [telegram](https://t.me/) web resource. No API key is required!

#### ü™≤ MIND BUG WHEN USING:
The script may currently produce false positives when identifying free usernames. This is due to Telegram‚Äôs reserved usernames, which are set aside for internal purposes. Additionally, there can be a delay before a username that has recently become available can be reused, so that username also may be marked as free but setting it is not available right now. I will fix it soon!

### Installation and Running (Locally)
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
  `git clone https://github.com/S4kur4H4run0/telegram-username-grabber.git`
  `cd telegram-username-grabber`

3. Create a virtual environment:
  `python3.12 -m venv env`

5. Activate the virtual environment:
  `source env/bin/activate`

7. Install the required packages:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Script
To run the script locally, use the following command:

`python script.py --file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/usernames/list.txt --verbose`

Replace script.py with the actual name of your Python script.

- The --file argument specifies the URL or path to the list of usernames.
- The --verbose flag enables detailed logging output.

### Running in GitHub Actions
To test the script in the GitHub Actions environment, create an issue using the Payload request template. In the issue body, provide a single URL and wait for approval to run the pipeline. ü•è

### Payload Limitations
- Only files hosted on raw.githubusercontent.com are supported.
- Usernames must be listed one per line.
- For format reference, see this [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Usernames/Names/names.txt) file.

**The results of workflow runs are accessible on the Actions page.**

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Have fun and choose any username you want by brute-forcing with your preferred list. Remember, a cool username is not worth account or username theft! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
